Atm using GUI in Java
I implemented an ATM that has a client and an admin. The client has 3 cards, 2 debit cards where he can deposit money, withdraw money within the available balance, interrogate the balance and convert the money into EUR or USD. At the same time, the date of the last transaction (deposit or withdrawal) is also displayed on the screen;
Money can be withdrawn on the credit card up to the limit of 2000 lei and the remaining balance can be questioned;
The admin can see the name, date of birth and all operations performed by the client;
